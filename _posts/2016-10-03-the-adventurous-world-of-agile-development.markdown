Inspired by the [C++ Lands][1] I have created a map for the Agile Devlelopment world in sketchnote style.

The journey to the agile continent through the Sea of Uncertainties, as the name says, uncertain and full of 
wrong turns. Although you can base your work on fundamental principles and some practices that seemed to be proven
in other companies, you really need to find out what works in your context.

Be aware not to strand on the "[Cargo Cult Island][3]" with the impressive [Scrumfalls][2], **itÂ´s NOT the agile mainland**!
