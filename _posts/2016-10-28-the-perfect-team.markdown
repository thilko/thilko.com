Today we had another monthly open space meeting at [Draeger][1] - this time with the topics team collaboration and mechanics. 

From my point of view team collaboration is a really important one. Couple of days ago I stumbled upon [Project Aristotle][2], a project at google to find out what drives team effectiveness. 

Interesting enough for me IÂ´ve created a little sketchnote about the quest for the 'perfect team':
