Last week I skipped the meetup of the Softwerkskammer Lübeck and went to ThoughtWorks in Hamburg to see
Sriram Narayan with ["Rework your IT to Scale Agile"][1]

Although the most if the stuff wasn´t really new for me since I already read the book, I found it really
inspiring to see/hear the author directly. 

My key take aways are:

* Organize for responsiveness and not for cost efficiency
* In big organizations barriers cannot be overcome  by team members or even managers
* Projects tends to deliver feature after feature without feedback if they are valid
* Prefer soft over hard predictability
* No projects!
