The [Softwerkskammer Lübeck][1] had it´s very first meeting at [Chaotikum][2] in Lübeck!

The "[Softwerkskammer][3]" is a community of people who like the idea of [software craftsmanship][6] and since there was no such community in Lübeck, I started a new one.

The feedback was overwhelming. Personally I had no big expectations for the first time, but around 20 interested participants was a wonderful start!

I started with a small presentation about the core principles of the Softwerkskammer and a short introduction about myself.

I also prepared an introduction into [Test Driven Development][4], but we changed that a bit to give everyone a chance to introduce themselves. In the end I performed a small prepared kata with [Hannes][5]. (thx for that!)

We had inspiring discussions and I did my first steps in [Smalltalk][9]. :-)

Especially our first location, the [chaotikum][2], was great. It´s located in the [centre of Lübeck][8] and a really creative hackspace.

Looking forward for the [next meeting][7] in 2015!
