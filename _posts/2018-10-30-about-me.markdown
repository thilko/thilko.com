For my current sketchnote courses I have created a new introduction.

I used a pencil to roughly sketch the structure and later I redraw the sketchnote with a fineliner. It expresses my most important work topics really
well:

* Software craftsmanship
* Agile coaching
* Building network of humans
* .. and sktchnoting ;-)
