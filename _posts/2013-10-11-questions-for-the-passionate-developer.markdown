We are developers. Maybe passionate developers. Sometimes it´s worth to step back and ask yourself questions. Questions
to check if you are on the right track. Here are some of them.

******************

1. When was the last time you produces something really ***valueable*** for your company?

2. When was the last time you gained some new tech knowledge that really fascinated and endorsed you in your profession
as software developer?

3. When was the last time you ***don´t spend time*** for solving team conflicts?

4. When was the last time you have had a honest and ***valuable*** discussion about the different coding style
with your collegue?

5. When was the last time that you had a tech discussion and afterwards you ***gained a better solution***?

6. When was the last time you speaking about **solutions** rather than ***problems***?

7. When was the last time you got into [the flow][1] during programming?

8. When was the last time you said: "Yeah, a really cool solution! Let´s tell someone about it!"

9. When was the last time you saw the happy face of your customer saying: "Good job, thank you!"?

10. When was the last time you felt ***like a child*** during exploring new libraries/frameworks or simply a cool feature of
your system?

11. When was the last time you where ***proud*** of your work?

Sometimes it´s good to [ask questions][2]. Even to yourself.

P.S.: Written with [MacVim][3]. And I am proud of it.
