This year I have been on my first [SoCraTes][1]! It was also my first [unconference][2] and a great experience I would like to share here.

## The venue

SoCraTes 2015 happened at the [Hotel Park Soltau][4]. It´s a bigger hotel complex with a many conference rooms, a wellness area and much space for doing [kung fu][5] exercises (which I used for me). The only disappointing thing for me was the slow and sometimes dysfunctional wireless there. But I have heard that it was better than last year.

The served food was really tasty and a bonus point for the venue. Even as an vegetarian there was enough and on day two they served a barbeque outside.

## The beginning

It started at thursday evening with a great come together and a [world coffee][3]. We had three session a´ 20 minutes in different rooms. In smaller groups we sat together a shared our ideas what we could talk about in the next two days. It was inspiring and I got a first glimpse that the next days will be surprising.

## Day one (Friday)
At 7am I met with other sport craftsman at the entrance for a run. I was NOT the only one! Can´t remember the exact number but maybe 14 people started for a 5/10km run. A great start for the first conference day.

We started at nine with an introduction into the [open space][6] concept. The moderator - [Pierluigi Pugliese][7] - did an awesome job in explaining the open space concept.

Around 10:30 the schedule with a lot of interesting talks was filled and only with a slight delay (not worth the mention since more than 180 people organized themself!).

Just some of interesting talks I´ve seen this day:

* Intro to visual notetaking and sketchnotes
* Description Craftsmanship (bringing craftsmanship principles to the requirements engineering)
* Functional programming with JavaScript and ramda.js
* Code retreat Constraints
* TDD in the C/C++ code (I had the chance to learn more about mocking in C)

We had various evening sessions: Coding Dojo(where I have been), [Powerpoint Karaoke][8] to name just a few. Not to forget the interesting conversations (with beer) at the hotel bar!

## Day two (Saturday)
I started my day with some kung lessons in the hotel garden. Since the area is quite spacious it was quite and I could focus on the execution.

Today the spirit of the conference got me and I proposed two talks: **"Groovify Java"** and **"How to change a company as a developer without becoming a manager"**.

The idea for the latter was to facilitate a lean coffee session and in order to share ideas about that. Since [@Fischermaen][9] proposed a conversation about agile transformations we quickly decided to join our sessions. We had great ideas there!

We talked about "acting as an example" and skunk awards as a way to change the organizational culture. You never can change a company alone, find willing people and build a coalition! Interesting thoughts: whenever you hear: "That does not work here!", ask: "What will work?" and _"Ask for forgiveness and not for permission"_.

So this day was really the time where I left my comfort zone. And it was great.

## Day three (Sunday)
After the last days was a bit more quite compared the former days. I had a relaxing breakfast with good talks about retrospectives. Today some workshops were scheduled. I joined the [Extreme Startup][10] session and although I was a bit late and couldn´t compete with the other groups I had quite a lot of fun and I will try the game at one of the next coding dojo sessions or at the [Softwerkskammer meetups][11].

## The sessions
Just as an appetizer:

* Advanced Git
* TDD does not lead to good design
* Scaling Agile
* Tackling the newsletter problem with TDD
* Concurrency, Robustness & Elixir

* How to manage different flavors of people
* Name and Gender Representation in Data and User Interfaces
* Refactoring Legacy Code
* ES6 Katas
* How to build an admin interface for REST Webservers
* Data analytics
* Code reviews
* (When) do we really need frameworks
* Vim! But better! Inside Emacs!
* Technology is not important
* Blender intro
* Code Retreat Constraints
* Expirience technical dept
* Your code as a crime scene
* Implement a game so that the source code can be used as game instructions
* Be Cat-Matic
* Code is music

## What you can expect
An intense, highly interactive conference with really enthusiastic people. It´s a community who lives the spirit of the software craftsmanship.

As Pierluigi said: __The conference is like an empty pot and it is filled with the people that are there.__ Every experience or thought is valuable and forms a community which helps each other in finding better solutions as a software craftsman.

I am happy the be a part of the community and looking forward to the next SoCraTes. Thanks for the great conference!
