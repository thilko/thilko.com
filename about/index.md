Since 2000 I develop software with passion in various companies. I believe in the values of the [software craftsmanship][5]. I love TDD, agile and lean principles, simplicity and producing     value early.    
I believe that continuous life-long learning + improving and curiosity are the most important skills of a craftsman and I try to implement it for me with dojos, katas, conferences and collaborating. I had my first conference talk at the [JavaZone][1].  

We as [software craftsman][3] need networks where we can collaborate, exchange ideas, share knowledge and improve our skills together. Since I believe in the power of those networks I founded the [Softwerkskammer L체beck][2], a place where developer from L체beck and around can meet.  
I practice [Dacascos Kung Fu][7] and live with my family in L체beck. Currently I work for [ELEMENT][14] as a software developer.

# ... less important, but interesting to know

Most of my time I worked with java(which I not always enjoyed). I had some good years with ruby and ruby on rails and currently I use groovy for testing(which I enjoy) applications written in Java.

I studied [economic engineering][4] and finished it with a diploma in 2003.

Companies I have worked for:

* [ELEMENT Insurance AG][14]
* [Dr채gerwerk][12]
* [Blau Mobilfunk GmbH (R.I.P.)][11]
* [Conergy (R.I.P.) ][10]
* [Talkline GmbH (R.I.P.)][9]
* [Brokat Technologies (R.I.P.)][8]
* [Arche Systems GmbH][13]
